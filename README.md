# Re:ceipt
Re:ceipt is a web app which makes it easier to rename image file as a designated format for internal employees when applying for workflow on [Flex](https://flex.team/), an all-in-one HR platform that streamlines tasks like attendance tracking, payroll, recruitment, and performance management.

Before using Re:ceipt, we had to follow these steps, which was inefficient and easy to forget:
1. Take a photo of a receipt
2. Send it to laptop/PC
3. Change the file name manually (e.g. JOHN_241105_lunch.jpg - NAME_DATE_CATEGORY.jpg)
4. Open the browser, go to the Flex page and upload the image file with changed file name

By using Re:ceipt, the process above has been streamlined to take **less than 1 minute**.
## Features
- User's name saved in localStorage
- Selecting an image file by opening the Camera app and taking a photo
- Selecting a date (default value: today)
- Selecting a category of workflow
- Preview of file name to be used for the image
- Downloading the image file with the changed file name on the device
- Link to the Flex company page
## Technologies Used
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
